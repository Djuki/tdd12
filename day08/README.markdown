# Day 8: Range

In mathematics we denote a range using open-closed bracket notation: [0,10) means all real numbers equal to or greater than zero, but less than ten. So 0 lies in this range, while 10 does not.

* 1. Develop an integer range class, that has the following operations:
Construction.
For example: r = new Range(0,10) // modify to fit your language's syntax
Checking whether an integer lies in the range.

What name do you think is appropriate?
Intersection of two ranges, creating a new range consisting of all integers that are in both ranges.

For example, the intersection of range [0..3] (numbers 0, 1, 2 & 3) and range [2..4] is the range [2..3]
What do you think should happen if the intersection is empty?
* 2. Develop another class to represent floating point ranges, with the same operations.

While developing the floating point range class, think about how it differs from the integer range.

Is it possible to modify the behaviour of one of them to become more consistent with the behaviour of the other? The more uniform their behaviour, the easier the classes will be to use.

If you modify one of the classes – do you feel confident you do not break anything? If you don’t feel confident, what can you do about that?
