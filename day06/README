# Day 6: Recently-Used List

Develop a recently-used-list class to hold strings uniquely in Last-In-First-Out order.

* A recently-used-list is initially empty.
* The most recently added item is first, the leastrecently added item is last.
* Items can be looked up by index, which counts from zero.
* Items in the list are unique, so duplicate insertions are moved rather than added.

Optional extras:

* Null insertions (empty strings) are not allowed.
* A bounded capacity can be specified, so there is an upper limit to the number of items contained, with the least recently added items dropped on overflow.
